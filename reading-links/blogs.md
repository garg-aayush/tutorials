## [2025 LLM Year in Review by Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/)

### TLDR:
**6 Key Paradigm Shifts:**

1. **RLVR (Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards)** - New training stage using automatically verifiable rewards (e.g., puzzles) for developing reasoning strategies with longer optimization and test-time compute control.

2. **Ghosts vs. Animals / Jagged Intelligence** - LLM intelligence is "summoning ghosts," not evolving animals; exhibits jagged performance—brilliant in specific domains, easily confused elsewhere. Benchmarks losing trust as they're susceptible to RLVR.

3. **Cursor / New Layer of LLM Apps** - Apps bundle LLM calls for specific verticals, handle context engineering, orchestrate complex DAGs, provide domain-specific GUIs, and offer autonomy sliders for human-in-the-loop control.

4. **Claude Code / AI that Lives on Your Computer** - First convincing LLM agent running locally with your private data and environment, acting as a resident spirit/ghost rather than a cloud service.

5. **Vibe Coding** - Building impressive programs via English becomes accessible to everyone; code becomes free, ephemeral, and malleable—democratizing software development.

6. **Nano Banana / LLM GUI** - Early hint of a true LLM Graphical User Interface enabling visual communication (images, infographics, videos) beyond text—how LLMs should speak in humanity's preferred format.

**Overall:** 2025 revealed LLMs as a new kind of intelligence with immense untapped potential and jagged capabilities simultaneously brilliant and vulnerable.
